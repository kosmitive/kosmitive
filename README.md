## Markus Semmler

I design and implement probabilistic and decision-making systems where uncertainty, dynamics, and constraints matter.

### Core areas

- 📐 State-space models (SSM, LGSSM, nonlinear SSMs)
- 🧠 Bayesian & probabilistic modeling (VI, MCMC, filtering, smoothing)
- 🤖 Reinforcement learning & control (model-based RL, model-free RL, MARL)
- 👁️ End-to-end deep learning pipelines for (LLM, CV)

### Delivery capabilities

- 🧪 Reproducible, research-quality implementations
- ⚡ Edge-optimized implementations (latency- and memory-constrained)
- ☁️ Scalable systems on distributed clusters (cloud & on‑prem)

Primary stack: Python, JAX, NumPyro, PyTorch, SciPy

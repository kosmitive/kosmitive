🧠 State-Space Modeling · 📐 Probabilistic Inference · 🤖 Reinforcement Learning · 🎯 Control-as-Inference

I design and implement probabilistic and decision-making systems where uncertainty, dynamics, and constraints matter.

- State-space models (SSM, LGSSM, nonlinear SSMs)
- Bayesian & probabilistic modeling (VI, MCMC, filtering, smoothing)
- Reinforcement learning & control (model-based RL, MARL)
- Control as inference (KL control, variational control)
- Reproducible research-quality implementations

Primary stack: Python, JAX, NumPyro, PyTorch, SciPy
